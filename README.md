# Intro

We are building this as a POC for managing the internal documents. The second version of this poc will be used to generate report.
In this project we are using a Naive RAG to return the re-ranked answers that are most suitable to the user query.

## Methodology

# TODOs

- Evaluation using Ragas / Trulens / Deepeval
- Create Report part by part
- Cache prompt
- Cost optimization techniques such as caping Tokens
